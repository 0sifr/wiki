### Tails

##### Contributing to the PGP web of trust #####
The tails team gave me this business card at a tech conference years ago. It contains the fingerprint for [the OpenPGP key](./tails_signing_key.asc) used to sign their [tailsOS releases](https://tails.net/install/index.en.html) (Signing key) and also the fingerprint for the key they use to encrypt emails using OpenPGP. Putting their business card here allows others to check for the authenticity of their downloads.
